# About
Demonstrates working with Entity Framework 6 to read back a person’s email addresses and phone numbers from a SQL-Server database. 

# Challenge
Missing in this example, a phone type and email type tables as the purpose was to create a code sample for a forum post from scratch with one hour to get it done. To take this code sample one step farther add tables for phone type and email type, remove email type and phone type string columns and replace with int columns to reference the phone type and email address table. This means that the configuration in ContactContext will need to change along with new models for phone type and email type.

Taking the challenge on for some will be frustating if time is not taken to learn rather than simply copy and pasting code and force feed missing parts mentioned above so take time to understand the current code.

Get stuck, formulate a question and post on Microsoft forums or StackOverflow.
